# My FFTCG Deckbuilding Theory
By: Kevin Fung

## General Thoughts

This is meant to chronicle my own personal general rules that I follow with regards to building decks and may not follow conventional wisdom. My goal is to create a deck with the most upside and consistency. Eureka wrote some great articles <a href="https://fftcgcrystarium.com/musings/the-golden-rule-of-fftcg-is-dead/">here</a> and <a href="https://fftcgcrystarium.com/musings/brief-introduction-to-the-japanese-playstyle-and-mentality/">here</a> in the past that are great jumping off points. My general belief is that a well built deck should be able to consistently beat an average built deck assuming both players are of similar skill levels.

## What makes a good deck?

In my opinion a good deck is an unfair deck. 

### "Tier 0"
In general, the goal is to create a "Tier 0" deck that "solves" the meta. This is done by identifying cards with insane abilities or incredible value. Usually there are certain prerequisites in order to unleash the full potential of these cards and require you to construct the deck around them. For Example, Macherie and Doga needed you to run a lot of summons particularly Earth/Water ones for the latter. Sterne Leonis required you to build a deck with a lot of forwards with ideally 3cp costs in order to maximize his abilities.

### Doga and Sterne Leonis
In Opus 14 and 15, Doga decks were the clear Tier 0 best decks with many of the core cards eventually becoming banned or limited: Doga, Sophie, Macherie, Syldra. These decks were so strong and prevalent that may of the card prices soared to over $50 and become unobtainable for many players. 

Sterne Leonis decks were able to eventually break through with chocobos utilizing the unfair abiliies of fat chocobo

## Where do I Start?

Usually when I start making a new deck, I identify the core cards that I want to build around. This could be a single powerful card, a tribal group of cards, or a small powerful package of 2-3 cards or so. Then I try to add cards around it to either support the core cards by enhancing consistency or complementing them by addressing weaknesses. 


## Which cards to put in a deck?

This is the million dollar question. 

To better understand the concepts, I'll go over an <a href ="https://ffdecks.com/deck/5608547535552512">example deck</a> I made and used in a <a href ="https://ffdecks.com/tournament/materia-cup-lspb-tx-1-16/5195805473374208">big tournament</a> last year.


### Unfair Core

As the much esteemed Kyle Peters and Ryan Chen put it, you can bring  <a href="https://youtu.be/CSuUGmeLL84?si=UidUzDjYY85fF2Ce&t=2472">50 good cards  </a> at all times.
